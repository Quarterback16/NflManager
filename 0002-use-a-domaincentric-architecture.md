# 2. Use a domain centric architecture

Date: 12017-04-12 

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need a way to organise the code so that it can be easily navigated.

## Decision

We will use a domain-centric architecture: http://localhost/HomeWiki/ow.asp?DomaincentricArchitecture

## Consequences

Code will be organised vertically along functional lines.  Domain and Application logic
can be tested on its own without any dependencies getting in the way.
